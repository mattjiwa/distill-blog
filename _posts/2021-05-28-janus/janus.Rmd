I recently started to explore generative art as a creative outlet that would allow me to gain better data wrangling skills in R (while doing what looked suspiciously similar to pissing about).

Here's some generative art made by a two-component reaction diffusion process. I first saw this style of art on [Antonio S치nchez Chinch칩n's blog](https://fronkonstin.com/2019/12/28/reaction-diffusion/) and gain further inspiration from articles by [Karl Sims](https://www.karlsims.com/rd.html) and [Robert Munafo](https://mrob.com/pub/comp/xmorphia/).

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '80%'} 
knitr::include_graphics("brainplot.png")
```

In short, the process generating these patterns is called the Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion model. The articles I linked above go into plenty of detail about the parameters guiding this process, so I won't rehash their work.

I also made some colour palettes based on that of the (pretty incredible) conspiracy drama [Utopia](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2384811/). The cinematography is pretty [vibrant](https://external-preview.redd.it/-jDVaUzmtdSYgYpbuyZI9UMx3m8WPGQIYFfRFtTE8qE.png?auto=webp&s=7e3a965e645d61b587486c00c2aa382db4c26a5b) so I wouldn't exactly call the figures it produces easy on the eye, but I like the aesthetic nonetheless.

Anyway, here's a summary of how the final images come together...

Starting out, I used the [reaction diffusion C++ code](https://github.com/aschinchon/reaction-diffusion) provided by Antonio S치nchez Chinch칩n to make some initial figures. To manipulate their appearance, I created a script that would automate the starting distributions of the two substances in the "reaction". This function allows me to dictate whether the starting pattern will be random, will be concentrated in a central circle/square/diamond, or will be spread across a series of concentric circles/squares/diamonds.

Here's an example of the type of image this can enable:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '80%'} 
knitr::include_graphics("basic_demo.png")
```

After that, I adapted the reaction diffusion equation to allow for variable feed and kill rates across the canvas. This enables even more varied diffusion patterns; patterns where the diffusion almost drips down the canvas, patterns where it pools primarily in the centre, and so on.

Again, it'd be easiest to demonstrate this with an example:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '80%'} 
knitr::include_graphics("varied1.png")
```

The penultimate stylistic layer involved using the [poissoned package](https://coolbutuseless.github.io/2019/06/25/poissoned-a-package-for-poisson-disc-sampling/) to generate points upon which a Voronoi diagram was overlaid. The colour of each of the tiles in the Voronoi tesselation was determined by the colour that lay directly beneath the point that the tile was centred on. Finally, the outline of each tile was also defined by the same value, but was given the inverse of the colour palette, to provide depth.

Lets check on the output to this point:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '80%'} 
knitr::include_graphics("voronoi_demo.png")
```

Finally, the tiles were shrunken inwards proportional to their concentration of the diffusing substance, B (i.e., their colour). This makes the background beneath the tiling visible, so I set that to take on the colour of one of the extremes of the colour gradient being used for the fill of the polygons.

And we arrive at the completed image! Here's an example of the end product:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '80%'} 
knitr::include_graphics("fullplot3.png")
```

There's plenty more to experiment with in this project; burn holes in the plot to explore the colour underneath...

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '80%'} 
knitr::include_graphics("hole_demo2.png")
```

Or animate the shrinking tiles to give it some energy...


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '80%'} 
knitr::include_graphics("animated.gif")
```
