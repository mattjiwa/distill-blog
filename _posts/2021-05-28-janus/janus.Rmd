Here's some generative art made by a two-component reaction diffusion process. I first saw this style of art on [Antonio Sánchez Chinchón's blog](https://fronkonstin.com/2019/12/28/reaction-diffusion/) and was further inspired by articles from [Karl Sims](https://www.karlsims.com/rd.html) and [Robert Munafo](https://mrob.com/pub/comp/xmorphia/).

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '60%'} 
knitr::include_graphics(here("_images", "brainplot.png"))  
```

In short, the process generating these patterns is called the Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion model. The articles I linked above go into plenty of detail about the parameters guiding this process, so I won't rehash their work.

I made some colour palettes based on that of the (pretty incredible) conspiracy drama [Utopia](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2384811/).
